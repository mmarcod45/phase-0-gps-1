#Reflection


*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?  I struggled with how to reconcile your local versus remote repos.  
*What concepts were clarified during the GPS? I learned more about how the workflow works with a collaborator and how merge conflicts get resolved locally and on github. 
*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I asked about the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'. I also asked a few questions about when to push and merge versus keep working locally. 
*What still confuses you about Git? I'm still confused about when to share with collaborator - how often. 
*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS. The experience was great. Good pacing and supportive environment to ask questions and learn from pair + guide.
