What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	I was struggling with the Merge Conflicts. I had not yet experienced a Merge Conflict and was a bit nervous about getting one. The GPS session clearly showed how to resolve a merge conflict and now will not worry when I get one. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	Fetch and Merge were clarified. I did not understand the difference between the two. This was discussed with my pair and guide. The difference was very subtle but easy to understand. My pair and I were able to use these commands on the terminal when switching driver and navigator roles. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	I asked my pair to further explain how to do a fetch and merge at the end of the GPS, which helped to reinforce my understanding of the concept. I asked my guide to explain why a user needs to create a branch and not work out of the master branch locally if it will affect any repositories in GitHub. I now understand it is best to create a new branch when working on a different feature of the project. 

What still confuses you about Git?
	Honestly, even though I understand the difference between fetch and merge it still confuses me. My goal is to be able to decide at what instance do a fetch or a merge. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Rubric
	My first experience was better than expected. I was nervous at first and did not know what to expect. The guide was very understanding whenever there was something we did not undestand and led us in the right direction when help was needed.
